# TcNo-Steam-Card-Assistant 
A simple Open-source extension for Steam Badge crafting and managing.

>### Why?
This plugin was created because crafting badges on Steam to level up your account can take a really long time, even if you know how to do it via the Chrome or Firefox console, using Javascript. AFAIK there are no plugins that allow you to craft multiple Steam Badges at once, and especially none that let you craft them from the Steam Badge list page.

>### Where to find the extensions:
